In this project you will develop a small program capable of causing great havoc. Although
the greatest virtue of ransomware is its ability to spread through networks of hundreds
of computers, in this case, your program will only affect a small part of your files.
## üõ† Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/salecler/stockholm_1.0.git
```
    
## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

To deploy this project run:

```bash
  ./bash_test
```
Then you can run it:
````
python3 stockholm
````
## ü§† Features

Flags:
- --reverse / -r
- --version / -v
- --help / -h
- --silent / -s


## üë®‚Äçüè´ Instructions

You will work at all times within a virtual machine. You will create a program called
stockholm that meets the following specifications.

‚Ä¢ It will be developed for the Linux platform.

‚Ä¢ Will only act on a infection folder in the user‚Äôs HOME directory.

‚Ä¢ The program will act only on files with the extensions that were affected by Wannacry.

‚Ä¢ You will include a file of no more than 50 lines called README.md with the
instructions of use and, if required, to compile it.

‚Ä¢ In case of compiled language, you will include all the source code of the program.

‚Ä¢ The program will rename all the files in the mentioned folder adding the ".ft" extension.

‚Ä¢ If they already have this extension, they will not be renamed.

‚Ä¢ Files will be encrypted with a known algorithm of your choice, which is considered
secure.

‚Ä¢ The key with which the files are encrypted will be at least 16 characters long.

‚Ä¢ The program will have the option "‚Äìhelp" or "-h" to display help.

‚Ä¢ The program will have the option "‚Äìversion" or "-v" to show the version of the
program.

‚Ä¢ The program will have the option "‚Äìreverse" or "-r" followed by the key entered as
an argument to reverse the infection.

‚Ä¢ The program will show each encrypted file during the process unless the option is
indicated "‚Äìsilent" or "-s", in which case the program will not produce any output.

‚Ä¢ The program will handle errors and will not stop unexpectedly in any case.
You can use any programming language as long as you meet these specifications. You
can use encryption libraries such as openssl or libsodium, but you will need to justify
your choice of encryption during evaluation.
